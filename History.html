                    <center><h2><b>Origami: How the Ancient Art of Paper Folding Evolved Over Time and Continues to Inspire</b></h2></center>
                    <p>For centuries, cultures have come up with creative ways to artistically approach, adopt, and adapt the paper craft. While many of these practices, including Korean Hanji, can be individually traced to specific countries of origin, most—including papier–mâché, a French-sounding craft that was actually conceived in ancient China—boast colorful histories that span cultures, countries, and even continents. One popular practice that has left a particularly extensive paper trail across the globe is origami, the art of paper folding. Though most closely tied to Japan, origami also has roots in China and Europe. Here, we explore the practice's unique history to understand how each culture has shaped the beautiful and beloved art form.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>What is Origami?</b></p>
                    <p>Origami is the art of paper folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.</p>
                    <p><b>History of Origami</b></p>
                    <p>Creatives from several countries helped shape origami into the practice it is today.</p>
                    <p><b>CHINA</b></p>
                    <p>Paper was invented in China around 105 AD, and folded paper—or zhezhi—most likely emerged shortly after. By 900 AD, paper yuanbao, or gold nuggets, were a staple at traditional Chinese funerals.</p>
                    <p>Created by meticulously folding gold or yellow paper into ingot currency, these ephemeral ornaments were crafted with the intention of being thrown into a fire at the end of the ceremony.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, paper folding would become a common practice. Though similar to Japanese origami, more modern Chinese paper-folding exhibits an interest in representing inanimate objects, like boats and boxes.</p>
                    <p><b>JAPAN</b></p>
                    <p>Paper was introduced to Japan in the 6th century. During this time, the practice of paper folding emerged as a ceremonial Shinto ritual. It was not until Japan's Edo Period (1603 – 1868) that origami would also be viewed as a leisurely activity and art form.</p>
                    <p>Like Japanese woodblock prints—an art form that also saw popularity during this time—origami works often featured flowers, birds, and other nature-based motifs. These subjects are also prevalent in contemporary origami, which remains true to the traditional Japanese practice in all ways but one: originally, the practice allowed artists to strategically cut the sheets of paper. Today, however, true origami is sculpted entirely through folds—an attribute the Japanese adopted from Europe.</p>
                    <p><b>EUROPE</b></p>
                    <p>In Europe, paper-folding is thought to have evolved from napkin-folding, a practice popularized in the 17th century. Much like Japanese origami, napkin-folding featured different methods and techniques that resulted in an array of abstract and figurative forms.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, this interest in folding moved beyond napkins at dinner parties and made its way into schools—namely, in Friedrich Fröbel‘s groundbreaking curriculum.</p>
                    <p>As the founder of kindergartens, Fröbel incorporated several hands-on activities into his “play and activity” institutes, including paper-folding. This familiarized children with origami, and eventually enabled the art form to flourish across the continent.</p>
                    <p><b>What are Origami Techniques?</b></p>
                    <p>Unlike kirigami—the variation of origami that uses paper cutting—origami only uses folding and creasing techniques. Most projects use a combination of the same basic techniques. These include pleat folds, mountain folds, reverse folds, sink folds, squash folds, and petal folds.</p>
                    <p><b>MATERIALS</b></p>
                    <p>Although origami can be made with any foldable paper, most artists prefer to use specialized origami paper. These materials tend to be thinner than drawing paper, and feature one colored or patterned side and one blank side.</p>
                    <p><b>Origami Today</b></p>
                    <p>Many contemporary origami artists continue to create works inspired by age-old techniques. Some, like Gonzalo Garcia Calvo and Mademoiselle Maurice, do not employ adhesives or cuts in their work, while others, like Cristian Marianciuc have creatively reinterpreted the practice through strategic snips. Scroll down to see some of Marianciuc's surreal interpretations.</p>

                    <center><h2><b>The Modern Life of Origami, an Art as Old as Paper</b></h2></center>
                    <center><h4>Precision is key, whether folding a humble crane or an interlocking modular structure. So is enthusiasm.</h4></center>
                    <p>“I would say the biggest rule is no cutting,” said Wendy Zeichner, the president and chief executive of OrigamiUSA. It’s “one piece of paper and no glue.”</p>
                    <p>OrigamiUSA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to educating the public about the art form. The group traces its roots to the 1950s, when Lillian Oppenheimer, one of its eventual founders, began to communicate with paper folders around the world, including Akira Yoshizawa in Japan, who is often credited as the father of modern origami — they would send each other diagrams explaining how to fold different shapes from a single square sheet of paper. Decades later, OrigamiUSA has around 1700 paying members, and it keeps track of nearly 90 community origami groups in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Origami as an art reaches back thousands of years. “Origami is really almost as old as paper,” Ms. Zeichner explained — it means “to fold paper” in Japanese — and paper in sheet form is thought to have been invented in China around 105 A.D. To start making shapes like cranes and frogs, it boils down to two basic techniques: mountain folds and valley folds, which are different ways to make the edges meet. After that, you can get creative.</p>
                    <p>Crimps, pleats and petal folds are just some of the ways to create different shapes. There are also sculptural techniques such as wet-folding, a process in which part of the paper is dampened, which weakens the paper fibers and makes it easier to shape. When it dries, the paper stiffens. For more advanced 3-D projects, folders will use something like Origamizer, a software that generates crease patterns.</p>
                    <p>A few years ago, NASA engineers were able to create foldable telescopes and a flower-shaped shade to block out light from distant stars by using paper-folding techniques. “If you want to send something in a rocket, it has to be packed small,” Ms. Zeichner said. “The same algorithms you would use in origami would be used in this.” The same goes for folding an airbag into a car, or creating pop-up homeless shelters.</p>
                    <p>Precision is key, whether someone is folding a humble crane or a complex modular structure with interlocking parts. So is enthusiasm. “The majority of people are either enthusiasts on the simple end or on the complex end,” said Jason Ku, a lecturer at M.I.T. and a faculty adviser to the origami club there, along with Erik Demaine, the youngest professor to be hired at M.I.T. Dr. Demaine teaches classes dedicated to geometric folding; in 2001, at the age of 20, he wrote his doctoral thesis on folding in different dimensions.</p>
                    <p>The goal is to arrive at the most efficient and elegant means of achieving a particular effect. “I want the result to be complex, but I want to simplify the process it takes to get there,” Dr. Ku said. “It reminds me of the quote in ‘Amadeus’: ‘There are simply too many notes.’”</p>
                    <p>As in math, it’s important to show your work. Sometimes this happens at origami gatherings, such as OrigaMIT’s annual convention, where paper folders from around the country come to spend a day at the school’s campus learning about new techniques. It can also happen online, in simple YouTube videos such as “How To Make a Paper Crane,” which has over 4 million views. “Showing your technique is one of the biggest aspects of origami,” said Taro Yaguchi, the founder of Taro’s Origami Studio in Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p>Before the 1950s, certain origami objects were more difficult to create, partly because diagrams weren’t standardized. Some guide books simply presented the results, without the necessary steps to get there. Yoshizawa, in Japan, and Samuel Randlett, in the United States, helped develop a set of international diagram conventions that is now referred to as the Yoshizawa-Randlett system.</p>
                    <p>“Before it got codified, it could be very confusing,” said Jeannine Mosely, a software engineer in Cambridge, Mass. Ms. Mosely is known for large-scale projects such as an origami Menger sponge, a series of cubes adding up to a giant cube, made out of business cards. At the time, the fact that she didn’t use square paper caused ripples throughout the origami community. “There were people who didn’t want anything to do with my work because I started with rectangles,” she said.</p>
                    <p>Which leads to another point: A big part of origami is the medium. “I feel my works are collaborations between paper and me,” Koshiro Hatori, a master folder in Japan, wrote in an email.</p>
                    <p>And diagrams and algorithms won’t be much help if you’re not using the right materials. “It’s a mistake a lot of beginner’s make: they go online and find the most beautiful kind of paper,” said Jewel Kawataki, a New York-based jewelry maker who creates different designs with chiyogami, a sleek fabric-like paper. “You can see their frustration in YouTube tutorials. They’ve used the wrong paper.”</p>

                <article>
                    <p>But even with quality paper, it can still be tricky to figure out how to get the right result. “One time, it took me about 10 hours to do a heart,” Ms. Kawataki said. “I couldn’t understand the diagram. You just have to be persistent.”</p>
                    <p>Paper folders are as diverse as their approaches to the art. “I love the fact that origami artists range from 5 to 100, and there’s no age limit on doing it. Although I suspect some people might get pushed out by arthritis,” Ms. Mosely said, laughing.</p>
                    <p>She began folding as a child in the 1950s and ’60s, but finding origami paper was difficult (and expensive). “I folded with the lined paper you do your homework on, or blank white typing paper,” she said. “Anytime a piece of paper came into my hands I would crease it and see what it did.”</p>
                    <p>Toshiko Kobayashi, an art therapist in Manhattan who grew up folding as a child in Tokyo after World War II, believes in the art’s ability to heal. “Just after the war, there was nothing. Paper was one of the readily available toys for me,” she said.</p>
                    <p>In New York, she has been busy introducing the art to different communities through the Origami Therapy Association in Manhattan, which she founded in 2002. She has a regular session on paper-folding techniques for visually impaired patrons at the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library in Manhattan.</p>
                    <p>For many, the practice is embraced for its calming aspects. “It’s lessened my anxiety a lot,” Ms. Kawataki said.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of techniques, the community, whether in person or online, keeps people excited about the art form. “Origamists from around the world will meet and fold together,” Ms. Mosely said. “They might not be able to talk to each other, but they can fold.”</p>
